# Online-shopping-system-project-using-Java
Recently i had worked on one project the goal of this project is to create a simplified Online Shopping System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, constructors, methods, and arrays. You will implement classes for Product, ShoppingCart, User, and Store to simulate an online shopping experience.
